## BUILDING TINYWL
	gcc tinywl.c -lwlroots -linput -lwayland-server 
		     -lxkbcommon -I/usr/include/pixman-1 
		     -I/usr/local/include/wlr -DWLR_USE_UNSTABLE
		     -o tinyWL
### FREEBSD 
 cc tinywl.c -L/usr/local/lib -lwlroots -lwayland-server 
 	-lxkbcommon -I/usr/local/include  -I/usr/local/include
	-I/usr/local/include/pixman-1 -I/usr/local/include/wlr 
	-DWLR_USE_UNSTABLE

# STRUCT
### wl_event_loop → /usr/include/wayland-server-core.h
    is used for dispatching signal across the application,
    being notified when data is available on various file 
    descriptors

### wl_backend  → /usr/include/wlr/backend.h
    The backend is responsie for abstracting the low level 
    input and output implementation. Each backend can generate
    zero or more output devices(such as monitor on your desk)

    The DRM backend utilizes LINUX DRM subsystem to render
    libinput backend utilizes libinputs to enumerate and control
    phisycal input devices
    The wayland backend outputs as windows on another wayland 
    compositor, allowing you to nest compositors.
    Usefull for debug.

    Multi backend which allow you to initialize several 
    backends at once and aggregate their input and output
    devices.This is necessary to utilize both drm and
    libinput simultaneously
