 * HOW TRANSACTIONS WORKS:
    1. You gather up(rassembler) informations from the blockchain
    	about the funds you're going to send, put toghether a transaction
   	and add digital signature to it.

    2. The digital signature is essential.They're the only way you can prove
        that you are the owner of the funds. and have the right to spend.
	 
	 If you use and exchange, the exchange handles it for you.
	 If you use a mobile wallet, it happens behind the scenes, when you make a transaction.

    3. Other nodes compare your signatures with you public key to validate
        your transaction.
