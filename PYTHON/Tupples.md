# ---- [ TUPPLES - PYTHON PROGRAMMING ] ----

## DEFINE TUPPLE

 * Tupples are immutable (they cannot be changed)
   Tuples are faster than list but they cannot be changed

```python
  words=("spam","eggs","sausages")
  # or
  my_tupple = "one","two","three"
  print(words[0]);
```
```python
dimensions = (100,50)
print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])
```
